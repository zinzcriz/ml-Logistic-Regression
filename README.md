# ml-Logistic-Regression
This is a machine learning project I did as part of a course by upgrad.

In this project I did the following steps:
### 1.Data cleaning & preparation
- Combining 3 dataframes
- Handling categorical variables(yes/no)
- Mapping categorical variables to integers
- Dummy variable creation
- Handling missing values
### 2.Test-train split & scaling
### 3.Model building 
- Feature elimination based on correlations
- Feature selection using RFE(coarse tuning)
- Manual feature elimination(using p values & VIFs)
### 4.Model evaluation
- Accuracy
- Sensitivity & Specificiity
- Optimal cut-off using ROC curve
- Precision & Recall
### 5.Predictions on Test set
